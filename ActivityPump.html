      <p>The ActivityPump protocol is a social networking protocol based upon
      the ActivityStreams 2.0 data format. It is derived from the protocol used
      by the pump.io social networking platform</p>
    </section>

    <section id='sotd'>
      <p>This document is a proposed submission to the ActivityStreams working
      group</p>
    </section>
    
    <section class='informative'>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>The ActivityPump specification takes knowledge that has been learned 
      through previous experimentation with standards for federated social 
      networking, such as OStatus, and applies them to produce a simpler and yet
      more powerful whole. Where appropriate, it attempts to build upon other
      existing protocols, but it replaces them where appropriate.</p>
      <section>
        <h2>Building Blocks</h2>
        <p>The two core building blocks selected for the protocol are HTTP 
        ([[!RFC2616]]) and [[!AS2]]; the former for its' ubiquity 
        and the latter for its' obvious application, expressiveness and 
        simplity. On top of this, WebFinger ([[!RFC7033]]) was selected for user 
        discovery and ??? for authentication.</p>
        <p>Other building blocks were examined and discarded:</p>
        <section>
          <h2>PubSubHubub</h2>
          <p>[[PUSH]] is a widely deployed protocol for the exchange of 
          notifications from a publisher to subscribers. Widely deployed, 
          [[PUSH]] can already be used to follow, in real time, the public 
          activity of millions of blogs.</p>
          <p>However, [[PUSH]] was designed for a publishing and subscription
          model in which all content is public, and while it is possible to 
          extend it to support non-public content, in doing so it becomes a very
          different protocol. In addition, setting up [[PUSH]] subscriptions
          becomes an additional "moving part" in the subscription machinery.</p>
          <p>[[PUSH]] is not incompatible with ActivityPump in general, but by
          the time the machinery to support private message delivery has been 
          added to the protocol, it becomes duplicative to additionally 
          implement [[PUSH]] for public message delivery; therefore, it is left
          as an extension which implementations may implement at their leisure</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h2>Salmon</h2>
          <p>[[Salmon]] is a protocol for delivering responses to a post to the
          original post's author. It was developed for Google Buzz as a method
          of conveying comments posted on that platform back to the blog from
          which the post originated.</p>
          <p>It was used in the same fashion by OStatus in order to support 
          replies in conversations; in this regard delivering them to recipients
          which may not subscribe to the post's author.</p>
          <p>While Salmon works for this purpose, it is itself highly complex. 
          In addition, it is built upon ATOM [[RFC4287]], while this 
          specification is built upon [[!JSON]], and it invents its' own 
          authentication system  which is both orthogonal to that used by the 
          rest of the protocol and highly complex. Finally, ActivityPump's 
          general post delivery mechanism provides the same functionality while 
          adding no additional complexity.</p>

  <section id="obj-id">
    <h2>Objects and Identities</h2>
    <p>All Objects in [[!AS2]] should have unique global identifiers. 
    ActivityPump extends this requirement; all objects distributed by the 
    ActivityPump protocol MUST have unique global identifiers; these identifiers
    must fall into one of the following groups:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>HTTPS URIs with their authority belonging to that of their originating
      server.</li>
      <li>acct: account URIs with their authority belonging to their originating
      server. This URI is only valid for objects of the <i>person</i> type. </li>
      <li>Randomly generated urn:uuid: URIs, for immutable objects with no
      owner. Servers SHOULD NOT permit these objects to change after first 
      encountered, to minimize the risk of spoofing. TODO: Can we eliminate these?</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Servers MUST validate the content they receive to avoid content spoofing
    attacks. In particular, servers MUST NOT trust client submitted content and
    MUST validate it against its' originating server; likewise, they MUST NOT
    trust content submitted by a server other than said content's origin</p>
    <div class="informative">
      As an example, if example.com receives the activity 
      <pre class="format">
        {"verb":   "like",
         "actor":  "https://example.net/~mallory",
         "object": {
            "id":       "https://example.org/~alice/note/23",
            "content":  "I'm a goat"
          }
        }
      </pre>
      it should dereference the <code>id</code> both to ensure that it exists
      and is a valid object, and that it is not misrepresenting the object
      (In this example, Mallory is likely spoofing an object allegedly posted
      by Alice)
    </div>
    <p>All objects must have the following properties:</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>id</dt><dd>The objects' unique global identifier</dd>
      <dt>self</dt><dd>For objects with an <code>acct</code> URI scheme, the
      URI of a dereferencable document (see <a href="#obj-dereference"></a>)</dd>
      <dt>objectType</dt><dd>The type of the object, if this differs from the
      default (per [[!AS2]]) note type</dd>
    </dl>

    <section id="obj-dereference">
    <h2>Dereferencing objects</h2>
    <p>As illustrated by the example in the previous section, it is sometimes
    necessary to dereference an object in order to retrieve its' contents. It
    is therefore first necessary to identify the URI to dereference. The 
    procedure for doing this depends upon which of the URI groups defined in
    the previous section the ID belongs to</p>
    <ol>
      <li>If the object's ID is a HTTPS URI, it must be directly dereferencable</li>
      <li>If the object posesses a URI with the <code>acct</code> scheme, it 
      must contain a <code>self</code> property with the dereferencable URI.
      If the dereferencer does not posess the object, then it should perform
      [[!RFC7033]] discovery on the URI to find a link with the <code>self</code>
      relation and <code>application/activitystreams+json</code> media type</li>
      <li><code>urn:uuid</code> URIs have no authority and are not dereferencable</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Once the dereferencable URI has been determined, then an updated 
    description of the object may be retrieved by performing a GET request on
    the URI. The requestor MUST express a preference for the 
    <code>application/activitystreams+json</code> mediatype. The request MUST
    be performed with authentication information corresponding to the requesting
    user; the server SHOULD make authorization decisions based upon this 
    information</p>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section id="users">
    <h2>Users</h2>
    <p>Users in ActivityPump are represented by any URI on which discovery may
    be done per [[!RFC7033]]. When entered directly into a user interface (for 
    example on a login form), it is desirable to support simplified naming. For
    this purpose cases, User ID normalization SHOULD be performed as follows:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>If the entered ID is a valid URI, then it is to be used directly</li>
      <li>If the entered ID is in the form which would be valid as an E-Mail 
      address, per [[!RFC5322]] section 3.4.1, then the ID shall be 
      interpreted by taking the entered value and using it as the path 
      component of a URI with the <code>acct</code> scheme.</li>
      <li>If the entered ID is in the form which would be a valid DNS name as
      defined in [[!RFC1034]], then it shall be interpreted as a 
      <acct>https</acct> URI whereby the hostname portion is the entered value 
      and the path portion is empty.</li>
      <li>Otherwise, the entered value should be considered invalid</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Once the user's URI has been identified, it should be dereferenced as per
    <a href="#obj-dereference"></a></p>
    
    <section>
      <h2><i>User</i> objects</h2>
      <p>User objects are ActivityStrems objects of the <code>person</code>
      <code>objectType</code>. User objects MUST have, in addition to the 
      properties mandated by <a href="#obj-id"></a>, the following properties:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>objectType</dt><dd>This MUST be <code>person</code></dd>

        <dt>url</dt><dd>A link to the user's "profile web page"</dd>

        <dt>following</dt><dd>An [[!AS2]] collection of the users
        that this user is following</dd>

        <dt>followers</dt><dd>An [[!AS2]] collection of the users
        that follow this user</dd>

        <dt>inbox</dt><dd>A reference to an [[!AS2]] collection comprising of all the
        messages received by the user; see <a href="#inbox"></a></dd>
        <dt>outbox</dt><dd>An [[!AS2]] collection comprising of all the messages
        produced by the user; see <a href="#outbox"></a>
      </dl>
      <p>Implementations may, in addition, provide the following properties:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>preferredUsername</dt><dd>A short username which may be used to 
        refer to the user, with no uniqueness guarantees</dd>

        the user</dd>
        <dt>summary</dt><dd>A quick summary or bio by the user about themself</dd>

  <section id="auth">
    <h2>Authentication</h2>
    <p>ActivityPump uses authentication for two purposes; first, to 
    authenticate clients to servers, and secondly to authenticate servers to
    each other. This is an area for discussion; Pump.io uses OAuth 1.0 for this
    in a somewhat clunky manner. OAuth 2.0 would be one possible solution; we
    would need to use it to define a protocol</p>
    <p>The authentication problem is somewhat complicated by </p>
  </section>

  <section id="collections">
    <h2>Collections and Streams</h2>
    <p>[[!AS2]] defines the collection concept; ActivityPump defines several
    collections with special behavior. Additionally, it defines a subset of 
    collections termed <a href="#streams">streams</a>. </p>

    <section id="followers">
      <h2>Followers Collection</h2>
      <p>Every user MUST have a followers collection. This is the default
      recipient list for otherwise unaddressed activities, and additionally
      is used as a distribution target for any activities addressed to the
      <a href="#public"></a></p>
    </section>

    <section id="following">
      <h2>Following Collection</h2>
      <p>Every user MUST have a following collection. This is a list of everybody
      that the user has followed</p>
    </section>

    <section id="favorites">
      <h2>Favorites Collection</h2>
      <p>Every user SHOULD have a favorites collection. This is a list of every
      object that the user has favorited (See <a href="#activity-favorite"></a>)
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="streams">
      <h2>Streams</h2>
      <p>The streams nomencluture is applied to any collection comprosed purely of 
      activities. These objects should be so declared using the <code>objectTypes</code>
      property:</p>
      <pre class="formatted">
        {
          "id": "https://example.com/~alice/my-stream",
          "objectType": "collection",

          "items": [ ... ]
        }
      </pre>
      <p>Streams are always presented in reverse chronological order</p>
      <p><b>Todo: new [[!AS2]] objectType?</b></p>
      <section id="outbox">
        <h2>Outbox</h2>
        <p>The <code>outbox</code> stream contains every object that the user
        has ever published, subject to the ability of the requestor to retrieve
        the object (That is, the contents of the outbox are filtered by the
        permissions of the person reading it)</p>

        <p>A client may submit an [[!AS2]] activity to the server 
        using a HTTP POST request to the dereferencable URI of the outbox collection. 
        In this case, the request's Content-Type MUST
        be <code>application/activitystreams+json</code>, and the request MUST be authenticated
        with credentials authorized to act on behalf of the user to whom the 
        outbox belongs. Such submitted activities will be added to the front of 
        the feed retrieved by GET requests to the same endpoint.</p>

        <p>Activity distribution and access control is per the audience targetting
        properties from the [[!AS2]] specification. For each entry in the 
        addressing properties of an object, the server shall</p>
        <ol>
          <li>If the entry is a collection, then the server MUST dereference the
          collection (with the user's credentials) and add each person in the
          collection to the list of recipients for the message. Servers MUST
          limit the number of layers of indirections through collections which
          will be performed, which MAY be one.
          <li>If the entry is not a collection, then the server MUST perform
          discovery on the object (which may not be of person 
          <code>objectType</code>) to discover its' activity-inbox address
          <li>Once the complete list of recipients has been determined, the 
          server MUST then perform a HTTP POST, with authorization as the 
          submitting user, of the submitted activity body to each endpoint.
        </ol>
        <p>Servers SHOULD perform such delivery asynchronously to completion of
        the original activity submission request, and SHOULD additionally retry
        delivery to recipients if it fails due to network error</p>
        <p>If no recipients are specified, the user's preferred default audience
        should be applied. The default value for the default audience SHOULD
        be the user's <a href="#followers">followers</a> collection</p>

      <section id="inbox">
        <h2>Inbox</h2>

        <p>The <code>inbox</code> stream contains all objects received by the user.
        The inbox MUST be filtered acording to the requestors' permission; this 
        MAY include allowing read access only to the owning user</p>

        <p>A server may submit a HTTP POST to the <a href="#obj-dereference">
        dereferencable URI</a> of the <code>inbox</code> endpoint. This request
        MUST be authenticated with the credentials of the user identified by the
        <code>actor</code> stanza of the activity being delivered. The request
        MUST be of the [[!AS2]] content type; it MUST be a single activity.</p>

        <p>The server SHOULD perform de-duplication of activities, whereby it 
        discards repeats of already delivered activities (this can occur if an 
        activity is addressed both to a user's followers, and a specific user 
        which happens to follow said user, and the server has failed to 
        de-duplicate the recipients list, for example). Such deduplication SHOULD
        be performed by comparing the <code>id</code> of the activities.</p>

  <section id="public-addressing">
    <h2>Public Addressing</h2>
    <p>In addition to [[!AS2]] collections and objects,

    <p>Activities addressed to this special URI shall be accessible to all

  <section id="activities">
    <h2>Activities</h2>
    <p>The core of any [[!AS2]] based protocol is activities within. ActivityPump
    places no restrictions on the activities which may be distributed; however,

      <h2><code>follow</code> and <code>stop-following</code></h2>

      action.</p>
      <p>These activities should be specifically delivered directly to the person
      being followed, in addition to any other recipients</p>
      <p>Upon recipt of one of these activities, the actor's server should forward
      the activities specifically to the object specified in the <code>object</code>
      property. Upon recipt, the server belonging to the user being followed 
      MUST add the actor to its' <a href="#followers">Followers collection</a>; 
      and the actor's server MUST add the target object to their 
      <a href="#following">Following collection</a>.

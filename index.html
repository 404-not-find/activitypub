      <p>The ActivityPump protocol is a social networking protocol based upon
      the ActivityStreams 2.0 data format. It is based upon experience gained from
      implementing and working with the OStatus and Pump.io protocols.</p>
    </section>

    <section id='sotd'>
      <p>This document is a proposed submission to the W3C Social working
      group</p>
    </section>

    <section class='informative'>
      <h2>Background</h2>
      <p>The ActivityPump specification takes knowledge that has been learned
      through previous experimentation with standards for federated social
      networking, such as OStatus, and applies them to produce a simpler and yet
      more powerful whole. Where appropriate, it attempts to build upon other
      existing protocols, but it replaces them where appropriate.</p>
      <section>
        <h2>Building Blocks</h2>
        <p>The two core building blocks selected for the protocol are HTTP
        ([[!RFC2616]]) and [[!ActivityStreams]]; the former for its' ubiquity
        and the latter for its' obvious application, expressiveness and
        simplicity.</p>
        <p>Other building blocks were examined and discarded:</p>
        <section>
          <h2>PubSubHubub</h2>
          <p>[[PUSH]] is a widely deployed protocol for the exchange of
          notifications from a publisher to subscribers. Widely deployed,
          [[PUSH]] can already be used to follow, in real time, the public
          activity of millions of blogs.</p>
          <p>However, [[PUSH]] was designed for a publishing and subscription
          model in which all content is public, and while it is possible to
          extend it to support non-public content, in doing so it becomes a very
          different protocol. In addition, setting up [[PUSH]] subscriptions
          becomes an additional "moving part" in the subscription machinery.</p>
          <p>[[PUSH]] is not incompatible with ActivityPump in general, but by
          the time the machinery to support private message delivery has been
          added to the protocol, it becomes duplicative to additionally
          implement [[PUSH]] for public message delivery; therefore, it is left
          as an extension which implementations may implement at their leisure.</p>
        </section>

          <h2>Salmon</h2>
          <p>[[Salmon]] is a protocol for delivering responses to a post to the
          original post's author. It was developed for Google Buzz as a method
          of conveying comments posted on that platform back to the blog from
          which the post originated.</p>
          <p>It was used in the same fashion by OStatus in order to support
          replies in conversations; in this regard delivering them to recipients
          which may not subscribe to the post's author.</p>
          <p>While Salmon works for this purpose, it is itself highly complex.
          In addition, it is built upon ATOM [[RFC4287]], while this
          specification is built upon [[!JSON]], and it invents its' own
          authentication system  which is both orthogonal to that used by the
          rest of the protocol and highly complex. Finally, ActivityPump's
          general post delivery mechanism provides the same functionality while
          adding no additional complexity.</p>
      </section>
    </section>
    <section id="Overview">
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>The ActivityPump protocol is broadly based on the distribution of
      <i>activities</i>, described using [[!ActivityStreams]]; these activities
      are produced in response to a user performing an action. Most activities
      are purely responsive in nature - they are produced as a response to a
      user <i>having</i> done something. In addition, certain actions posted
      by a user to their <a href="#outbox">outbox</a> may trigger certain
      operations on the user's behalf. Finally, actions may have side effects
      as they propogate throughout the social graph. As an example of this:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>A user posts the <code>like</code> activity to their outbox. This
        activity causes the user's server to perform an action on behalf of
        the user; in particular, it adds the specified object to the collection
        of objects the user has liked.</li>
        <li>A consequence of the above action (per
        <a href="#notification"></a>) is that the server hosting
        the liked object will be notified of the operation, and will normally
        add the activity to the list of "likes" the object has received</li>
        <li>Finally, the server receiving the like will distribute this activity
        to everyone it distributed the original object to</li>
      </ol>
    </section>
    <section id="specification-profiles">
      <h2>Specification Profiles</h2>
      <p>This specification defines two closely related and interacting
      protocols:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>A client to server protocol, or "Social API"</dt>
        <dd>This protocol permits a client to act <i>on behalf</i> of a user.
        For example, this protocol is used by a mobile phone application to
        interact with the user's social stream</dd>
        <dt>A server to server protocol, or "Federation Protocol"</dt>
        <dd>This protocol is used to distribute activities between users on
        different servers, tying them into one social graph.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>All servers claiming conformance to this specification are required to
      implement the former protocol, and may optionally implement the latter.
      This gives three conformance classes:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>ActivityPump conformant Client</dt>
        <dd>This designation applies to any implementation of the entirety
        of the client portion of the client to server protocol</dd>
        <dt>ActivityPump conformant Server</dt>
        <dd>This designation applies to any implementation of the entirety
        of the server portion of the client to server protocol</dd>
        <dt>ActivityPump conformant Federated Server</dt>
        <dd>This designation applies to any implementation of the entirety of
        the server portion of both the client to server and federation
        protocols</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>It is called out whenever a portion of the specification only applies
      to implementation of the federation protocol. In addition, whenever
      requirements are specified, it is called out whether they apply to the
      client or server (for the client-to-server protocol) or which of a pair of
      servers in the server-to-server protocol.</p>
    </section>
  </section>

  <section id="obj">
    <h2>Objects</h2>
    <p>Objects are the core concept around which both [[!ActivityStreams]] and
    ActivityPump are built. Objects can be divided into three main categories:
    <a href="#activities">Activities</a>, <a href="#content-objects">Content
    Objects</a> and <a href="#actors">Actors</a>, plus a small collection of
    objects which do not fit into the previous categories such as
    <a href="#groups">groups</a></p>
    <p>Servers MUST validate the content they receive to avoid content spoofing
    attacks. In particular, servers MUST NOT trust client submitted content, and
    federated servers also MUST NOT trust content received from a server other than the content's
    origin. Servers MUST validate such against its' originating server.</p>
    <div class="informative">
      As an example, if example.com receives the activity
      <pre class="format">
        {"verb":   "like",
         "actor":  "https://example.net/~mallory",
         "object": {
            "@id":      "https://example.org/~alice/note/23",
            "author":   "https://example.org/~alice",
            "content":  "I'm a goat"
          }
        }
      </pre>
      it should dereference the <code>id</code> both to ensure that it exists
      and is a valid object, and that it is not misrepresenting the object
      (In this example, Mallory is likely spoofing an object allegedly posted
      by Alice)
    </div>
    <section id="obj-id">
      <h2>Object Idenitifers</h2>
      <p>All Objects in [[!ActivityStreams]] should have unique global identifiers.
      ActivityPump extends this requirement; all objects distributed by the
      ActivityPump protocol MUST have unique global identifiers; these identifiers
      must fall into one of the following groups:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>HTTPS URIs with their authority belonging to that of their originating
        server.</li>
        <li>An ID explicitly specified as the JSON <code>null</code> object, which
        implies an anonymous object (a part of its' parent context)</li>
      </ol>
      <p>A server receiving an object with no specified <code>id</code> should
      allocate an object ID in the user's namespace and attach it to the posted
      object</p>
      <p>All objects must have the following properties:</p>
      <dl>
        <dt>id</dt><dd>The objects' unique global identifier</dd>
        <dt>@type</dt><dd>The type of the object</dd>
      </dl>
    </section>

    <section id="obj-uri">
      <h2>Dereferencable Object URIs</h2>
      <p>As illustrated by the example in the previous section, it is sometimes
      necessary to dereference an object in order to retrieve its' contents. It
      is therefore first necessary to identify the URI to dereference. The
      procedure for doing this depends upon which of the URI groups defined in
      the previous section the ID belongs to</p>
      <ol>
        <li>If the object's ID is a HTTPS URI, it must be directly dereferencable</li>
        <li>Objects with a <code>null</code> ID have no authority and are not
        dereferencable (their content is a part of their parent object)</li>
      </ol>
    </section>
    <section id="obj-methods">
      <h2>Methods on objects</h2>
      <p>There are several common operations upon social objects, which
      are expressed using standard HTTP methods applied to the Object's
      <a href="#obj-uri">dereferencable URI</a>. To avoid conflict with existing
      standards (and hence support "multiprotocol" server implemnetations),
      the scope of requests which servers are required to honor as defined in
      this specification is limited as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Notwithstanding the following, the <code>DELETE</code> method will
        always be honored as specified in <a href="#method-delete"></a></li>
        <li>All non-idempotent operations shall have a request body.</li>
        <li>For all operations with a request body, it MUST have the media type
        <code>application/activitystreams+json</code>, or where explicitly
        permitted the <code>multipart/related</code> media type with a root part
        of type <code>application/activitystreams+json</code></li>
        <li>Servers MAY use HTTP content notification as defined in [[!RFC7231]]
        to select the type of data to return in response to a request. For
        requests without a body, an <code>Accept</code> header MUST be
        specified, and the behavior defined by this specification ONLY applies
        if content negotion results in the selection of the
        <code>application/activitystreams+json</code> media type. For requests
        with a body, the client MAY omit the <code>Accept</code> header, in
        which case the server MUST provide successful responses as defined by this
        specification</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Servers MAY implement other behavior for requests which do not comply
      with the above requirements (for example, servers may implement additional
      legacy protocols, or may use the same URI for both HTML and
      ActivityStreams representations of a resource)</p>
      <p>Servers MAY require authorization and implement their own authentication
      rules. Servers SHOULD fail requests which do not pass their authorization or
      authentication checks with the appropriate HTTP error code, or the 404 Not
      Found error code where the existence of the object is considered private.</p>

      <section id="method-get">
        <h2>The <code>GET</code> method</h2>
        <p>The GET method shall return an up-to-date version of the object</p>

        <h2>The <code>PUT</code> method</h2>
        <p><b>This method requires user authorization</b></p>
        <p>The PUT method may be used by a client to update the version of the
        object stored on the server.</p>
        <p>The server MUST insert an activity with the <code>update</code> verb
        and this object as its' <code>object</code> into the actor's
        <a href="#outbox">feed</a></p>
      </section>
      <section id="method-delete">
        <h2>The <code>DELETE</code> method</h2>

        <p>The <code>DELETE</code> method may be used by a client to delete the

    <h2>Actors</h2>
    <p>Actors in ActivityPump are represented by HTTP URI. When entered directly into a user interface (for
    example on a login form), it is desirable to support simplified naming. For
    this purpose cases, ID normalization SHOULD be performed as follows:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>If the entered ID is a valid URI, then it is to be used directly</li>
      <li>Otherwise, the entered value should be considered invalid</li>
    </ol>

        de-duplicate the recipients list, for example). Such deduplication MUST
        be performed by comparing the <code>id</code> of the activities and
        dropping any activities already seen.</p>

    <h2>Notification and Delivery</h2>
    <p>Notification and Delivery are two closely related acts. Notifications are
    sent to <i>objects</i> and are used to perform updates on the
    social graph, whilst delivery is the act of inserting an activity into a
    recipient <i>agent's</i> inbox</p>
    <section id="delivery">
      <h2>Delivery</h2>
      <p>Activity distribution and access control is per the audience targetting
      properties from the [[!ActivityStreams]] specification. For each entry in the
      addressing properties of an object, the server shall</p>
      <ol>
        <li>If the entry is a collection, then the server MUST dereference the
        collection (with the user's credentials) and add each person in the
        collection to the list of recipients for the message. Servers MUST
        limit the number of layers of indirections through collections which
        will be performed, which MAY be one.
        <li>If the entry is not a collection, then the server MUST perform
        discovery on the object (which may not be of person
        <code>@type</code>) to discover its' activity-inbox address
        <li>Once the complete list of recipients has been determined, the
        server MUST then deliver the activity to each recipient. For a federated
        implementation, this must be done by performing a HTTP POST, with prohom
        authorization as the submitting user, of the submitted activity body to
        the URI of the <a href="#inbox">inbox</a> collection of each recipient
      </ol>
      <p>For federated servers performing delivery to a 3rd partry server,
      delivery SHOULD be performed asynchronously to completion of
      the original activity submission request, and SHOULD additionally retry
      delivery to recipients if it fails due to network error</p>
      <p>If no recipients are specified, the user's preferred default audience
      should be applied. The default value for the default audience is
      implementation specific but MAY be the user's
      <a href="#followers">followers</a> collection</p>
      <p>In addition to delivery to recipients, the server MUST also perform
      notification as specified by <a href="#notification"></a></p>
    </section>
    <section id="notification">
      <h2>Notification</h2>
      <p>When a user creates an activity (by submitting it to their
      <a href="#outbox">outbox</a>), the server should perform <i>notification</i>.
      Notification is the process of propogating awareness of the new activity to
      the activity's origin server such that the origin can act upon the activity
      (for example, notification that a user has liked an object is used to update
      the objects' like count) and distribute the activity to ensure that it is
      propogated to the whole social graph which received the original object.</p>
      <p>Notifications shall be sent to each of the following objects:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The Objects specified by the activity's "object" and "target" properties</li>
        <li>Any Objects specified in the activuty object's "inReplyTo" property</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Servers may perform notification to local objects as they choose.
      Federated servers MUST notify remote objects using the
      <a href="#method-notify">NOTIFY</a> method except by agreement with the
      3rd party server.</p>
      <p>An object notified of an activity MUST <a href="#delivery">deliver</a>
      that activity to all <a href="#object-recipient">recipients of the object</a>
      and in addition notify all <a href="#activity-share">share activities</a>
      of the object.</p>

    <section id="public-addressing">
      <h2>Public Addressing</h2>
      <p>In addition to [[!ActivityStreams]] collections and objects,
      Activities may additionally be addressed to the special "public"
      audience denoted by the object</p>
      <pre>
        {
          "@id": "http://activityschema.org/collection/public",

      <p>Activities addressed to this special URI shall be accessible to all
      users, without authentication.</p>
      <p>For the purposes of delivery, the server shall treat the public
      collection as if it contains the same entries as the user's
      <a href="#followers">followers collection</a>.
      <p>TODO: New URI? Can we get as:public in the schema or such?</p>

  <section id="content-objects">
    <h2>Content Objects</h2>
    <p>There are objects which have a <code>content</code> property, the value of which
    is provided by the user. These can be for example note, blog, image, etc.

    <section id="reply-objects">
      <h3>Reply Objects</h3>
      <p>A response can be any content object. The object MUST have an additional
      <code>inReplyTo</code> property. This property should have the object that
      your reply is in response to.</p>
      <pre>

      <p><b>This is only applicable to federated implementations:</b> When a response
      is sent to the outbox of a user, it should be propegated to the original server
      thateauthored the object that the response is in reply to. That server should then
      send that response to all recipiants that the original object was sent to.</p>

    <h2>Activities</h2>
    <p>The core of any [[!ActivityStreams]] based protocol is activities within.
    Users post activities to their <a href="#outbox">outbox</a>, from which they
    are distributed to recipients' <a href="#inbox">inboxes</a>. ActivityPump
    places no restrictions on the activities which may be distributed; however,
    it defines certain activities with special behaviors</p>
